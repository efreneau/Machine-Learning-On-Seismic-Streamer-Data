## Machine Learning On Seismic Streamer Data ##

The goal is to create a model for noise given airgun depth, hydrophone depth and range during seismic reflection surveys. This project uses regression in Python training on **Line 06** and test using **Line 05** from the *R/V Marcus G. Langseth* on cruise *MGL1212* from July 12–24, 2012.
